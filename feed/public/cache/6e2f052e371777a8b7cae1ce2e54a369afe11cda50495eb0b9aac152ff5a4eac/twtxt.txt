2023-04-17T13:16:04Z	(#pud4w2q) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> That has no relevance to the point!
2023-04-17T13:16:54Z	(#pud4w2q) @<movq https://www.uninformativ.de/twtxt.txt>  Cheers! I'm happy to agree to disagree too of course! Thanks for engaging!
2023-04-18T13:15:24Z	On LinkedIn I see a lot of posts aimed at software developers along the lines of "If you're not using these AI tools (X,Y,Z) you're going to be left behind."  Two things about that: 1. No you're not. If you have good soft skills (good communication, show up on time, general time management) then you're already in excellent shape. No AI can do that stuff, and for that alone no AI can replace people 2. This rhetoric is coming directly from the billionaires who are laying off tech people by the 100s of thousands as part of the class war they've been conducting against all working people since the 1940s. They want you to believe that you have to scramble and claw over one another to learn the "AI" that they're forcing onto the world, so that you stop honing the skills that matter (see #1) and are easier to obsolete later. Don't fall for it. It's far from clear how this will shake out once governments get off their asses and start regulating this stuff, by the way--most of these "AI" tools are blatantly breaking copyright and other IP laws, and some day that'll catch up with them.   That said, it is helpful to know thy enemy.
2023-04-18T14:39:32Z	(#54piw5q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I would politely suggest again that we not react to people with bad attitudes who talk shit about yarn. If twt is forked, it should be forked to add features that are otherwise not possible. Not to appease people who will probably never be appeased.
2023-04-18T15:14:48Z	(#lc7khva) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> yeah. I'd add "Big Data" to that hype list, and I'm sure there are a bunch more that I'm forgetting.  On the topic of a GPU cluster, the optimal design is going to depend a lot on what workloads you intend to run on it. The weakest link in these things is the data transfer rate, but that won't matter too much for compute-heavy workloads. If your workloads are going to involve a lot of data, though, you'd be better off with a smaller number of high-VRAM cards than with a larger number of interconnected cards. I guess that's hardware engineering 101 stuff, but still...
2023-04-18T15:46:24Z	(#54piw5q) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> yes!
2023-04-19T13:07:55Z	(#mk4mxkq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> I'm a bit of a GPU junkie (😳) and I have 3, 2019-era GPUs lying around. One of these days when I have Free Time™ I'll put those together into some kind of cluster....
2023-04-19T16:06:26Z	[ChatGPT and Elasticsearch: OpenAI meets private data | Elastic Blog](https://www.elastic.co/blog/chatgpt-elasticsearch-openai-meets-private-data)  Terrifying. Elasticsearch is celebrating that they're going to send your private data to OpenAI? No way.
2023-04-19T23:37:31Z	(#7p3yc2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> ack, I didn't see this before. Get well soon!
2023-04-21T16:05:46Z	(#tvcahla) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> everyone's moving to gated communities!
2023-04-21T17:17:08Z	(#tvcahla) @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> this is alarmingly catchy
2023-04-21T20:05:28Z	(#5lowz6q) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> yeesh, it's a for-pay company I wouldn't give them the output of your mind for free and train their AI for them.
2023-04-21T20:54:03Z	(#5lowz6q) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> Who says you need to use anything like that? Where's the pressure coming from?
2023-04-21T21:00:10Z	(#zyhzp7q) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> I also think it is best called fake. Art is created by human beings, for human beings. It mediates a relationship between two people, and is a means of expression.   A computer has no inner life, no feelings, no experience of the world. It is not sentient. It has no life. There's nothing "in" there for it to express. It's just generating pixels in patterns we've learned to recognize.  These AI technologies are carefully crafted to fool people into experiencing the things they experience when they look at human-made art, but it is an empty experience.
2023-04-23T13:03:02Z	(#zyhzp7q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt>   (1) You go to the store and buy a microwave pizza. You go home, put it in the microwave, heat it up. Maybe it's not quite the way you like it, so you put some red pepper on it, maybe some oregano.  Are you a pizza chef? No. Do we know what your cooking is like? Also no.  (2) You create a prompt for StableDiffusion to make a picture of an elephant. What pops out isn't quite to your liking. You adjust the prompt, tweak it a bunch, till the elephant looks pretty cool.  Are you an artist? No. Do we know what your art is like? Also no.  The elephant is "fake art" in a similar sense to how a microwave pizza is "fake pizza". That's what I meant by that word. The microwave pizza is a sort of "simulation of pizza", in [this sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation). The generated elephant picture is a simulation of art, in a similar sense, though it's even worse than that and is probably more of a simulacrum of art since you can't "consume" an AI-generated image the way you "consume" art.
2023-04-23T13:05:47Z	(#5lowz6q) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt>  > I have to write so many emails to so many idiots who have no idea what they are doing  So it sounds to me like the pressure is to reduce how much time you waste on idiots, which to my mind is a very good reason to use a text generator! I guess in that case you don't mind too much whether the company making the AI owns your prompt text?  I'd really like to see tools like this that you can run on your desktop or phone, so they don't send your hard work off to someone else and give a company a chance to take it from you.
2023-04-23T13:14:38Z	(#5lowz6q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> > There is (I assure you there will be, don’t know what it is yet…) a price to be paid for this convenience.  Exactly prologic, and that's why I'm negative about these sorts of things. I'm almost 50, I've been around this tech hype cycle a bunch of times. Look at what happened with Facebook. When it first appeared, people loved it and signed up and shared incredibly detailed information about themselves on it. Facebook made it very easy and convenient for almost anyone, even people who had limited understanding of the internet or computers, to get connected with their friends and family. And now here we are today, where 80% of people in surveys say they don't trust Facebook with their private data, where they think Facebook commits crimes and should be broken up or at least taken to task in a big way, etc etc etc. Facebook has been fined many billions of dollars and faces endless federal lawsuits in the US alone for its horrible practices. Yet Facebook is still exploitative. It's a societal cancer.  All signs suggest this generative AI stuff is going to go exactly the same way. That is the inevitable course of these things in the present climate, because the tech sector is largely run by sociopathic billionaires, because the tech sector is not regulated in any meaningful way, and because the tech press / tech media has no scruples. Some new tech thing generates hype, people get excited and sign up to use it, then when the people who own the tech think they have a critical mass of users, they clamp everything down and start doing whatever it is they wanted to do from the start. They'll break laws, steal your shit, cause mass suffering, who knows what. They won't stop until they are stopped by mass protest from us, and the government action that follows.  That's a huge price to pay for a little bit of convenience, a price we pay and continue to pay for **decades**. We all know better by now. Why do we keep doing this to ourselves? It doesn't make sense. It's insane.
2023-04-23T14:52:19Z	(#zyhzp7q) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> What do you mean when you say that art is a lie?
2023-04-23T20:54:23Z	(#zyhzp7q) @<carsten http://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt>  Animals have inner lives. Computers do not.  Are you really so desperate to make this point thst you're citing _Quora_??? Believe what you want to believe.
2023-04-23T20:56:47Z	(#zyhzp7q) @<carsten http://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt>  You are conflating "aiming your eyes at" with "viewing art". These are fundamentally different activities.
2023-04-23T20:59:10Z	(#zyhzp7q) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt>  So a fiction novel, which is labelled "fiction", is a lie? I still don't understand. The word "lie" entails an intention to deceive, but fiction writing does not intend to deceive.
2023-04-25T21:04:20Z	(#zyhzp7q) @<darch https://neotxt.dk/user/darch/twtxt.txt> Made up is not the same as lie. That's obvious isn't it?!?!
2023-04-26T13:10:51Z	(#pg5dg7q) @<thecanine https://twtxt.net/user/thecanine/twtxt.txt> wow this is horrifying. What happened to Opera? It used to be my favorite browser but now they're like that one cousin who started getting into drugs, and then got in trouble with the law, and then before you know it they're scamming old ladies out of their pension money.
2023-04-26T18:58:24Z	(#ujrsmkq) @<carsten https://yarn.zn80.net/user/carsten/twtxt.txt> That's a dissembling answer from him. Github is owned by Microsoft, and CoPilot is a for-pay product. It would have no value, and no one would pay for it, were it not filled with code snippets that no one consented to giving to Microsoft for this purpose. Microsoft will pay $0 to the people who wrote the code that makes CoPilot valuable to them.  In short, it's a gigantic resource-grab. They're greedy assholes taking advantage of the hard work of millions of people without giving a single cent back to any of them. I hope they're sued so often that this product is destroyed.
2023-04-26T19:08:15Z	There is a "right" way to make something like GitHub CoPilot, but Microsoft did not choose that way. They chose one of the most exploitative options available to them. For that reason, I hope they face significant consequences, though I doubt they will in the current climate. I also hope that CoPilot is shut down, though I'm pretty certain it will not be.  Other than access to the data behind it, Microsoft has nothing special that allows it to create something like CoPilot. The technology behind it has been around for at least a decade. There could be a "public" version of this same tool made by a cooperating group of people volunteering, "leasing", or selling their source code into it. There could likewise be an ethically-created corporate version. Such a thing would give individual developers or organizations the choice to include their code in the tool, possibly for a fee if that's something they want or require. The creators of the tool would have to acknowledge that they have suppliers--the people who create the code that makes their tool possible--instead of simply stealing what they need and pretending that's fine.  This era we're living through, with large companies stomping over all laws and regulations, blatantly stealing other people's work for their own profit, cannot come to an end soon enough. It is destroying innovation, and we all suffer for that. Having one nifty tool like CoPilot that gives a bit of convenience is nowhere near worth the tremendous loss that Microsoft's actions in this instace are creating for everyone.

2023-04-29T13:51:43Z	[BlueSky is cosplaying decentralization](https://rys.io/en/167.html#)  > I say “ostensibly decentralized”, because BlueSky’s (henceforth referred to as “BS” here) decentralization is a similar kind of decentralization as with cryptocurrencies: sure, you can run your own node (in BS case: “personal data servers”), but that does not give you basically any meaningful agency in the system.  I don't know why anyone would want to use this crap. It's the same old same old and it'll end up the same old way.
2023-04-29T17:30:48Z	(#645gw7a)  I get that there are groups of people who don't have many good options besides Bluesky, so moistly this is griping about how bad social media is generally, and how the lousy people in charge continue to be in charge.
2023-04-30T17:52:13Z	(#ru6tlia) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  yes, I agree. It's bizarre to me that people use the thing at all let alone pay for it.
2023-05-02T13:09:36Z	(#jrfpcaa) @<Phys_org https://feeds.twtxt.net/Phys_org/twtxt.txt>  using the phrase "machine learning" in this article is misleading and bandwagoning. They used a neural model, which neuroscientists were doing long before "machine learning" became a popular term.
2023-05-03T13:03:51Z	I've seen BlueSky referred to as BS (as in **B**lue **S**ky, but you know...), which seems apt.  CEO is a cryptocurrency fool, as is Jack Dorsey, so I don't expect much from it. Then again I'm old and refuse to join any new hotness so take my curmudgeonly opinions with a grain of salt.  I read somewhere or another that the "decentralization" is only going to be there so that they can push content moderation onto users. They will happily welcome Nazis and fascists, leaving it up to end users to block those instances.  I wonder how they plan to handle the 4chan-level stuff, since that will surely come.
2023-05-03T14:04:35Z	(#fghhzwa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I know very little about it, but speaking secondhand, it looks like there's a single centralized server now and they're still building the ability to federate? Like, the current alpha they're running is not field testing federation, which makes me think that's not a top priority for them.
2023-05-03T14:08:36Z	(#fghhzwa) Do they legitimately believe that end users will encounter videos of gruesome murders, live streams of school shootings, etc etc etc, and be like "oh, tee hee hee, that's not what I want to see! I'd better block that!" and go about their business as usual?  No, they can't possibly be that foolish. They are going to be doing some amount of content moderation. Just not of Nazis, fascists, or far right reactionaries. Which to me means they want that content on there.
2023-05-03T14:49:24Z	Looks like Google's using this blog post of mine without my permission. I hate this kind of tech company crap so much.   ![](https://anthony.buc.ci/media/NjTvtPh9FVMHcXJhvs3vME.png)
2023-05-03T14:50:57Z	(#eaewypq) There's a link to the blog post, but they extracted a summary in hopes of keeping people in Google properties (something they've been called out on many times).  I was never contacted to ask if I was OK with Google extracting a summary of my blog post and sticking it on the web site. There is a very clear copyright designation at the bottom of each page, including that one. So, by putting their own brand over my text, they violated my copyright. Straightforward theft right there.
2023-05-03T14:53:40Z	(#eaewypq) I have no interest in doing anything about it, even if I had the time (which I don't), but these kind of thing happen all day every day to countless people. My silly blog post isn't worth getting up in arms about, but there are artists and other creators who pour countless hours, heart and soul into their work, only to have it taken in exactly this way. That's one of the reasons I'm so extremely negative about the spate of "AI" tools that have popped up recently. They are powered by theft.

2023-05-04T15:20:51Z	(#h7gltfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  > Taking Jordan Peterson asn an example, the only thing he “preaches” (if you want to call it that) is to be honest with yourself and to take responsibility.  This is simply untrue. Read the articles I posted, seriously.   In a tweet in one of the articles I posted, Peterson states there is no white supremacy in Canada. This is blatantly false. It is disinformation. Peterson has made statements that rape is OK (he uses "fancy" language like "women should be naturally converted into mothers" but unpack that a bit--what he means is legalized rape followed by forced conception). He is openly anti-LGBTQ and refuses to use peoples' preferred pronouns. He seems to believe that women who wear makeup at work are asking to be sexually harassed.  He's using his platform in academia to pretend that straight, white men are somehow the most aggrieved group in the world and everyone else is just whining and can get fucked. The patron saint of Men's Rights Activists and incels. I find him odious.
2023-05-04T15:23:12Z	(#h7gltfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Because they are rightwing assholes with a huge platform and they are literally *HURTING PEOPLE*. People get attacked because of things people like Shapiro and Peterson say. This is not just idle chitchat over coffee. They are saying things like it's OK to rape women (and NO I am not going to dig out the videos where they say that --that's up to YOU to do, do your own homework before defending these ghouls).
2023-05-04T15:24:18Z	(#h7gltfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It went there because you are supporting bad people who themselves operate at the level of outrage. You cannot have a "debate" about the ideas of someone like Peterson or Shapiro, *because those ideas should not be considered debate-worthy*. Rape is not OK, period, the end. It is not up for debate or discussion. Yet Peterson acts as if it is. That is abhorrent, and unacceptable in 2023.
2023-05-04T15:24:56Z	(#h7gltfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Maybe so, but that's not because of the people who are objecting to Jordan Peterson, that's for sure. You really need to read the articles I've posted before going there. Really.
2023-05-04T16:11:18Z	(#h7gltfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> When you unpack what he's saying in that video (which I've watched, and just now re-watched), and strip away all his attempts to wrap this idea in fancy-sound language, he is saying: it would be better if women were viewed as property of men, because then if they were raped, the men who owned them would get mad and do something about it. Because rape would be a property crime then, like trespassing or theft. Left unspoken by him, but very much known to him, is that the man/men who "own" a woman can then have their way with her, just like they can freely walk around their yard or use their own stuff. In his envisioned better world, it'd be impossible for a husband to rape his wife, for instance, because she is his property and he can do almost anything he wants (that's literally what "property" is in Western countries).  It's so fucked up it's hard to put into words how fucked up it is. And this isn't the only bad idea who bangs on about!

He's known for that, but I've seen it myself. So, to be clear, I don't know if Ben Shapiro is a rape apologist and have no evidence of that. Wouldn't surprise me frankly because the set of ideas he does talk about tends to include being A-OK with crimes against women, but anyway.

I don't get how a house that's going to be underwater soon is worth $1 million, but then I'm never been a free market fundamentalist either so 🤷 Maybe they're all watertight.
2023-05-09T12:21:31Z	(#h7gltfa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> hmm, dunno about the recency of that line of thought. I suspect though that given his (recent or not) history, if someone directly asked him "do you support rape" he would not say "no", he'd go on one of these rambling answers about property crime like he did in the video. Maybe I'm mind poisoned by being around academics my whole career, but that way of talking is how an academic gives you an answer they know will be unpopular. PhD = Piled Higher And Deeper, after all right? In other words, if he doesn't say "no" right away, he's saying "yes", except with so many words there's some uncertainty about whether he actually meant yes. And he damn well knows that, and that's why I give him no slack.  There are people in academia who believe adult men should be able to have sex with children, legally, too. They use the same manner of talking about it that Peterson uses. We need to stop tolerating this, and draw hard red lines. No, that's bad, no matter how many words you use to say it. No, don't express doubts about it, because that provides justification and talking points to the people *who actually carry out the acts*.

2023-05-09T13:24:15Z	(#rt3ekma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt>  > Let’s assume for a moment that an answer to a question would be met with so many words you don’t know what the answer was at all. Why? Why do this? Is this a stereotype of academics and philosophers? If so, it’s not a very straight-forward way of thinking, let alone answering a simple question.  Well, I can't know what's in these peoples' minds and hearts. Personally I think it's a way of dissembling, of sowing doubt, and of maintaining plausible deniability. The strategy is to persuade as many people as possible to change their minds, and then force the remaining people to accept the idea because they think too many other people believe it.  Let's say you want, for whatever reason, to get a lot of people to accept an idea that you know most people find horrible. The last thing you should do is express the idea clearly and concisely and repeat it over and over again. All you'd accomplish is to cement people's resistance to you, and label yourself as a person who harbors horrible ideas that they don't like. So you can't do that.  What do you do instead? The entire field of "rhetoric", dating back at least to Plato and Aristotle (400 years BC), is all about this. How to persuade people to accept your idea, even when they resist it. There are way too many techniques to summarize in a twt, but it seems almost obvious that you have to use more words and to use misleading or at least embellished or warped descriptions of things, because that's the opposite of clearly and concisely expressing yourself, which would directly lead to people rejecting your idea.  That's how I think of it anyway.
2023-05-09T13:34:42Z	(#rt3ekma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> maybe it doesn't fool you, but it fools lots of people and has for thousands of years. That's why politicians (for instance) keep doing it.
2023-05-09T15:35:28Z	(#rt3ekma) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> It's a fun challenge to see how many words you can say without expressing any ideas at all. Maybe this GPT stuff should be trained to do that!

2023-05-10T12:23:22Z	(#5bl6sta) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> @<eldersnake https://we.loveprivacy.club/user/eldersnake/twtxt.txt> I love VR too, and I wonder a lot whether it can help people with accessibility challenges, like low vision.   But Meta's approach from the beginning almost seemed like a joke? My first thought was "are they trolling us?" There's open source metaverse software like [Vircadia](https://vircadia.com) that looks better than Meta's demos (avatars have legs in Vircadia, ffs) and can already do virtual co-working. Vircadia developers hold their meetings within Vircadia, and there are virtual whiteboards and walls where you can run video feeds, calendars and web browsers. What is Meta spending all that money doing, if their visuals look so weak, and their co-working affordances aren't there?  On top of that, Meta didn't seem to put any kind of effort into moderating the content. There are already stories of bad things happening in Horizon Worlds, like gangs forming and harassing people off of it. Imagine what that'd look like if 1 billion people were using it the way Meta says they want.  Then, there are plenty of technical challenges left, like people feeling motion sickness or disoriented after using a headset for a long period of time. I haven't heard announcements from Meta that they're working on these or have made any advances in these.  All around, it never sounded serious to me, despite how much money Meta seems to be throwing at it. For something with so much promise, and so many obvious challenges to attack first that Meta seems to be ignoring, what are they even doing?
2023-05-10T12:41:05Z	(#5bl6sta) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I think those headsets were not particularly usable for things like web browsing because the resolution was too low, something like 1080p if I recall correctly. A very small screen at that resolution close to your eye is going to look grainy. You'd need 4k at least, I think, before you could realistically have text and stuff like that be zoomable and readable for low vision people. The hardware isn't quite there yet, and the headsets that can do that kind of resolution are extremely expensive.  But yeah, even so I can imagine the metaverse wouldn't be very helpful for low vision people as things stand today, even with higher resolution. I've played VR games and that was fine, but I've never tried to do work of any kind.  I guess where I'm coming from is that even though I'm low vision, I can work effectively on a modern OS because of the accessibility features. I also do a lot of crap like take pictures of things with my smartphone then zoom into the picture to see detail (like words on street signs) that my eyes can't see normally. That feels very much like rudimentary augmented reality that an appropriately-designed headset could mostly automate. VR/AR/metaverse isn't there yet, but it seems at least possible for the hardware and software to develop accessibility features that would make it workable for low vision people.

2023-05-11T13:13:28Z	My desktop computer developed a really annoying vibration-induced buzzing sound a few months ago after I added some hard drives to it. It was one of these where it'd be more or less quiet, and then all of a sudden a buzzing would start. If you tapped the case, it often made the buzzing stop.  One by one I went through my components, and the day before yesterday I finally identified the guilty party, one particular HDD. Currently I have the case open and a piece of cardboard jammed under the drive in its tray. The computer has not buzzed since I did that, so it looks to me like securing that drive better will finally end this madness-inducing sound.  Wild that it takes so long to track down something like this and figure out what to do about it.

They are trying to generate a widespread disaster.   They *must* be stopped, immediately, without hesitation. This is unacceptable behavior, crossing every red line we have no matter our politics, without any doubt.
2023-06-06T13:07:05Z	(#k5eii3q) This demands a response from Europe, the world, not just Ukraine.
2023-06-06T14:10:11Z	(#k5eii3q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I said nothing about an international violent response. You added that 🤔   If someone punches you in the face over and over again, you don't stand there and take it to avoid "begetting violence". You stop them from punching you, and do your best to ensure they never punch you again. That's not "violence begets violence". That's rationality.
2023-06-06T15:07:25Z	(#k5eii3q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't agree. I think he's a thug who benefits a lot if everybody thinks he's a madman.  All through this war, there has been a repeated cycle: - We can't give Ukraine weapon X; that will provoke Putin and he'll drop a nuke! - Russian propagandists threaten they're about to drop nukes - After lots of hand wringing, some country gives weapon X to Ukraine - No nukes are dropped  We're on like the 5th iteration of this. Now it's about F-16 fighter jets. In the meantime, a lot of Ukrainians AND Russians are dying en masse.
2023-06-06T18:43:33Z	(#k5eii3q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yeah, it's a horrible waste.
2023-06-07T13:05:01Z	(#k5eii3q) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> I think I understand NATO's hesitation, but at the same time if this drags on and on for years then it causes massive loss of life and is even more dangerous for everyone. If that nuclear power plant melts down, whether because Russia causes it directly or because of an "accident", then all of Europe can be blanketed with fallout. The longer this goes on, the more likely that possibility (and worse ones!) becomes.  That is scary to be so close to Russia. I hope you're doing OK.

2023-06-15T18:07:04Z	![](https://anthony.buc.ci/media/bmYHa4PjzLz6E9mozAgvGM.png)   Let's be clear here. Daniel Penny allegedly choked a black man, Jordan Neely, to death on a subway car. Neely was being loud, but he was not physically threatening anybody and did not have a weapon. In any other context, this would be called "murder", at the very least, "manslaughter" if one were being gracious. Because of the US's history, a white man murdering a black man in sight of the public is oftentimes, and rightfully, called a "lynching". It has a public, political purpose amounting to terrorism.  Daniel Penny was allowed to go free for awhile after this event. He is only now facing accountability, having been recently indicted (arrested and charged with a crime) as he should have been day of. And here is racist right-wing toadie Ben Shapiro saying that *Daniel Penny*--the white alleged killer--is the one being lynched. Not the black man who was allegedly murdered *by Penny* in view of the public, and who is now dead.  Penny himself, who is still very much alive.  @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/>, I don't know how you go on defending Ben Shapiro, but in the context of US society, what Shapiro is saying is reprehensible and unacceptable. He's a right-wing troll with disgusting, not to mention flat out stupid, opinions.

2023-07-04T14:16:46Z	(#y7ldi4q) @<marado https://twtxt.net/user/marado/twtxt.txt> It can't possibly be defensible, which to me always signals an attempt at a power grab. They never explicitly said "we will use anything we scrape from the web to train our AI" before--that's new. There is growing pushback against that practice, with numerous legal cases winding through the legal system right now. Some day those cases will be heard and decided on by judges. So they're trying to get out ahead of that, in my opinion, and cement their claims to this data before there's a precedent set.

2023-07-22T17:21:03Z	(#kyuurnq) I take it back. Excalidraw is like tldraw--you can integrate it into a Javascript front end if you want. Which means technically you could self-host it if you wanted, but you'd have to write your own front end code to embed it, and host that code somehow.

So, you could do all kinds of different math stuff in a notebook environment and share that with people. But on top of that, there was a chat system, a collaborative editing system, a course management system (so if you were teaching a class using it you could keep track of students, assignments, grades, that sort of thing), and a bunch of other stuff I never used. It all ran in a linux container with python/conda as a base, so you could also drop to a terminal, install stuff in the container, and run X11 applications in the same environment. I never taught a class with it but I used to use it semi-regularly to experiment with ideas.

I don't recall disconnecting myself from sending and receiving emails. I don't even know how you disconnect someone from that. I also have never created the email address this email appears to be coming from, but maybe I should trust it anyway since they told me it's a trusted source? Most puzzlingly, I've been sending and receiving emails just fine all morning, so I do not appear to be disconnected from anything? I want to help protect the internet and fight malicious activities, but what should I do??? 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

2023-07-25T14:53:43Z	I've only been using `snac`/the fediverse for a few days and already I've had to mute somebody. I know I come on strongly with my opinions sometimes and some people don't like that, but this person had already started going ad hominem (in my reading of it), and was using what felt to me like sketchy tactics to distract from the point I was trying to make and to shut down conversation. They were doing similar things to other people in the thread so rather than wait for it to get bad for me I just muted them. People get so weirdly defensive so fast when you disagree with something they said online. Not sure I fully understand that.
2023-07-25T15:38:22Z	(#kzsbkna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> attacking the person, not the idea. It'd be like if you said "yarn is better than mastodon because it isn't push based" and someone who disagreed with you said "well you think that because you're an idiot" or something like that.
2023-07-25T16:17:02Z	(#kzsbkna) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> Well, you can mute or block individual users, and you can mute conversations too. I think the tools for controlling your interactions aren't so bad (they could definitely be improved ofc). And in my case, I was replying to something this person said, so it wasn't outrageous for his reply to be pushed to me. Mostly, I was sad to see how quickly the conversation went bad. I thought I was offering something relatively uncontroversial, and actually I was just agreeing with and amplifying something another person had already said.
2023-07-26T13:13:47Z	The hottest 21 days ever recorded on Earth were the last 21 days.  There are climate scientists saying that this summer will be the coolest summer of the rest of our lives. It won't get cooler.  They can say that with confidence because Earth's energy imbalance--the difference between how much energy comes in versus how much is radiated back to space--has been positive since around 2010. Prior to that, the balance would shift negative sometimes, so Earth would radiate a bunch of energy back into space. Not anymore. Earth is an energy sponge now. And net positive incoming energy means temperatures go up.  Climate disaster has been here for awhile, but it's kicking into high gear now. This will not change until we take drastic action.

Every person who has WiFi enabled on their phone can be tracked throughout the city as their phones ping various base stations; a lot of folks aren't aware of just how much information can be slurped out of a phone that isn't locked down just from its WiFi pings. I know this happens in Toronto, and I was familiar with a startup in Massachusetts that based its business model on this very concept. I can only assume it's widespread in the US if not throughout the Western world.

2023-08-07T13:41:15Z	(#axkd3eq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> @<jmjl https://tilde.green/~jmjl/twtxt/twtxt.txt> It looks like there's a `podman` issue for adding the `context` subcommand that `docker` has. Currently `podman` does not have this subcommand, although [this comment](https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/12811#issuecomment-1153128175) has a translation to `podman` commands that are similar-ish.  It looks like that's all you need to do to support `podman` right now! Though I'm not 100% sure the containers I tried really are running remotely. Details below.  I manually edited the shell script that `cas.run add` returns, changing all the `docker` commands to `podman` commands. Specifically, I put `alias docker=podman` at the top so the check for `docker` would pass, and then I replaced the last two lines of the script with these:  ``` podman system connection add cas  "host=tcp://cas.run..." podman system connection default cas ```  (that ... after `cas.run` is a bunch of connection-specific stuff)  I ran the script and it exited with no output. It did create a connection named "cas", and made that the default. I'm not super steeped in how `podman` works but I believe that's what you need to do to get `podman` to run containers remotely.  I ran some containers using `podman` and I *think* they are running remotely but I don't know the right juju to verify. It looks right though!  This means you could probably make minor modifications to the generated shell script to support `podman`. Maybe when the check for `docker` fails, check for `podman`, and then later in the script use the `podman` equivalents to the `docker context` commands.
2023-08-07T14:21:58Z	(#axkd3eq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I had a feeling my container was not running remotely. It was too crisp.  `podman` is definitely capable of it. I've never used those features though so I'd have to play around with it awhile to understand how it works and then maybe I'd have a better idea of whether it's possible to get it to work with `cas.run`.   There's a `podman`-specific way of allowing remote container execution that wouldn't be too hard to support alongside `docker` if you wanted to go that route. Personally I don't use `docker`--too fat, too corporate. `podman` is lightweight and does virtually everything I'd want to use `docker` to do.
2023-08-07T14:58:38Z	(#axkd3eq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't get your objection. `dockerd` is 96M and has to run all the time. You can't use `docker` without it running, so you have to count both. `docker` + `dockerd` is 131M, which is over 3x the size of `podman`. Plus you have this daemon running all the time, which eats system resources `podman` doesn't use, *and* `docker` fucks with your network configuration right on install, which `podman` doesn't do unless you tell it to.  That's way fat as far as I'm concerned.  As far as corporate goes, `podman` is free and open source software, the end. `docker` is a company with a pricing model. It was founded as a startup, which suggests to me that, like almost all startups, they are seeking an exit and if they ever face troubles in generating that exit they'll throw out all niceties and abuse their users (see Reddit, the drama with spyware in Audacity, 10,000 other examples). Sure you can use it free for many purposes, and the container bits are open source, but that doesn't change that it's always been a corporate entity, that they can change their policies at any time, that they can spy on you if they want, etc etc etc.  That's way too corporate as far as I'm concerned.  I mean, all of this might not matter to you, and that's fine! Nothing wrong with that. But you can't have an alternate reality--these things I said are just facts. You can find them on Wikipedia or docker.com for that matter.
2023-08-07T15:00:33Z	(#axkd3eq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> My understanding is that `podman` can talk to the Docker Engine API. It's just that the commands sometimes have different names in the `podman`verse. I think--never used those features.
2023-08-07T15:42:47Z	(#axkd3eq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't understand what you're saying. `podman` works with TLS. It does not have the "--docker" siwtch so you have to remove that and use the exact replacement commands that were in that github comment.
2023-08-08T12:37:27Z	(#42qgz2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> what do you mean when you say "Docker API"? There are multiple possible meanings for that. `podman` conforms to *some* of Docker's APIs and it's unclear to me which one you say it's *not* conforming to.  You just have to Google "podman Docker API" and you find stuff like this: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-rest-api  ## What is Podman's REST API?  Podman's REST API consists of two components: - A **Docker-compatible** portion called Compat API - A native portion called Libpod API that provides access to additional features not available in Docker, including pods   Or this: https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-system-service.1.html > The REST API provided by podman system service is split into two parts: a compatibility layer offering **support for the Docker v1.40 API**, and a Podman-native Libpod layer.
2023-08-08T13:08:30Z	(#42qgz2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> podman supports TLS.

2023-08-08T14:36:32Z	(#42qgz2q) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> hmm, bummer. I was hoping that translating the `docker` commands to `podman` syntax would work but it looks like it's more subtle than that. Thanks for trying!  The weird thing was I wasn't getting errors like that on my end when I tried it. `podman` thought the connection was created, and it set it as the default. But I don't think it was sending anything over the wire. When I have more time to tinker with it maybe I'll play around and see if I can figure out what's up.
2023-08-08T15:31:21Z	Found another example of Google stealing something I've written and putting it in a "featured snippet".  What's super annoying about this one is that the source is a course page at Tufts University, not the official page of the publication they're taking this text from.

It's polluting the world with false information, false images, false "academic" articles, false books. The companies that create this stuff are not cleaning up their misinformation spill; they're letting the mess spread all over. It's being used to commit crimes, and that'll only get worse.

2023-08-27T13:46:00Z	(#bf5yqda) @<mckinley https://twtxt.net/user/mckinley/twtxt.txt> Yes, I'm still with jmp.chat, and still very happy with them overall. Their beta period ended and their pricing increased a bit, so that's worth a bit of consideration. I also managed to get one of their eSIMs. I'm slightly less happy with that aspect of their service, though they seem to be actively working on improving it and I knew in advance this was an early beta kind of thing and likely to have issues.  The only unreliability with calls that I've noticed was traceable to the unreliability of my own internet connection. I've confused incoming calls by simultaneously making and taking calls from the computer and the phone, but I think it's understandable that problems might arise and that's not a real use case for me. Once or twice I did not receive a text transcription of a voice mail, but the support is usually quick to address things like that.  I host my own XMPP server and have for a good decade now, and that's what I use with jmp.chat. I can't speak to the quality of their hosting options.  Group texting works fine for me if one of the other parties initiates the group text. I haven't tried to initiate my own group text in well over a year; last time I did, it didn't work. That may or may not be a problem for you, and it may or may not have been fixed by now. Worth investigating more if it's important. I should also say I've only ever used group texts with 3 participants, and can't speak to what happens if there are more nor whether there are upper limits.  Group texts don't use MUC. Rather, they use a special syntax in the JID, something like "+1XXX,+1YYY,...,+1ZZZ@cheogram.com", where the + and , are required, the XXX, YYY, through ZZZ are the phone numbers (no dashes or other special chars just digits), and the @cheogram.com at the end is required.  I recommend the cheogram app if you're on android. It has a lot of nice features on top of the Conversations base. I use gajim on my (linux) computer and it works well with jmp.chat.  I'm happy to answer other questions if you have them!
2023-08-28T14:35:55Z	(#vkofzva) @<jmjl https://tilde.green/~jmjl/twtxt/twtxt.txt> I'm sorry that I'm not super knowledgeable about alternatives to jmp.chat but I'll tell you what I know.   You're probably right about jmp.chat not working for you, at least as it is now. You can only get US and Canadian phone numbers through it last time I checked, so if you're not in either of those countries you'd be making international calls all the time and people who wanted to call you would be making international calls too.  I've seen people talk about using SIP as an intermediary: you can bridge SIP-to-XMPP, and bridge SIP-to-PSTN (PSTN = "packet switched telephone network", meaning normal telephone). You can skip the SIP-to-XMPP side if you're comfortable using a SIP client. I don't know very much about SIP or PSTN so I am not sure what to recommend, but perhaps this helps your search queries.  There are a fair number of services like TextNow that let you sign up for a real telephone number that you can then use via their app (I wouldn't use TextNow--they had tons of spyware in their app). I don't know if that kind of service works for you but if it does perhaps you'd be able to find one of them that isn't horrible. This page (https://alternativeto.net/software/jmp-chat/) has a bunch of alternatives; I can't vouch for any of them but maybe it's a starting point if you want to go this route.  Good luck!
2023-08-30T14:25:17Z	(#xevmcwa) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> Horseshit hype: - AI that we have today cannot think--there is no cognitive capacity - AI that we have today cannot be interviewed--"inter" "viewing" is two minds interacting, but AI of today has no mind, which means this is a puppet show - AI today is not free--it's a tool, a machine, hardly different from a hammer.

2023-09-01T13:06:16Z	(#7dxtvnq) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> It's worth bearing in mind that  - Fairphone has taken a considerable amount of VC funding so, sooner or later, that bill will become due: (see: https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/fairphone-growth-capital-raise and https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fairphone) - Fairphone comes with Google Play apps by default, so it's also a spyware vector (see: https://mastodon.ar.al/@aral/110978014080809471)  I used to have a lot of hope for them but these two ingredients mean that [enshittification](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/enshittification) is virtually inevitable.

2023-09-01T13:27:24Z	(#if5eb2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I've had a Teracube phone for about 3 years now. Theirs comes with a guarantee of 4 years--if something that's covered breaks, you send the phone to them and they fix it and send it back, or they send you a new one. I took advantage of that last year when the screen broke; their tech support even helped me figure out how to wipe the phone when the screen didn't display anything. Pretty painless all around. Have to say I've been very happy with it. It doesn't have the top-end features that new big company phones have, but I don't want those features so that's not an issue for me. I dunno if it's available in Australia or if it's just a US thing.
2023-09-01T13:30:47Z	(#if5eb2a) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/> F-droid. Getting APKs from developers you trust and side-loading them. Some flavor of Linux. Some distro of the open source parts of Android.  There are lots of options. Bit by bit I divest from anything that's distributed from Google Play. With my latest phone I find and download APKs so that I could have the app without all the Google crap woven through it. By the time I need to replace this one I'll be fully free of Google Play. Most of my apps come from F-droid now. You can a perfectly functional phone/pocket computer unless you're addicted to installing dozens of corporate apps.
2023-09-01T13:31:46Z	(#if5eb2a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yes, the OS is based on stock Android, so probably wouldn't be of interest if you prefer Apple.
2023-09-01T13:35:07Z	(#eqvdabq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> yeah, it's true. Thing is, Linux as a desktop operating system sucked in 1996 yet I adopted it then anyway because I wanted nothing to do with MS anymore 😆 I know it's not for everyone but I'm pretty tolerant of a less-than-stellar experience if it means I can be free of big-company garbage.  I haven't tried a Linux-based smartphone OS in a long time so I don't have any idea how bad/good it might be. I figure when I finally break down and get a new phone I'll experiment on my current phone.
2023-09-01T13:45:04Z	(#if5eb2a) @<adi https://twtxt.net/user/adi/twtxt.txt> I think it is, and one benefit they have is that you can add third-party repositories to the F-Droid app as you discover them. So, for instance, if you know of a developer who pushes builds to an F-Droid compatible repository, you can add that to your F-Droid app and start tracking updates like you would for any other app in there. Can't do that with Google Play!  F-Droid tends to focus on open source applications that can be built in a reproducible way, which limits the inventory (though of course tends to mean the apps are safer and don't spy on you). There are non-free apps in there as well but they come with warnings so you're informed about what you might be sacrificing by using them.   That said if you have a favorite app you get through Google Play, there's a decent chance it won't be in F-Droid. Many "big corporate" apps aren't, and vendor-specific apps tend not to be either. But for most of the major functions you might want, like email clients, calendar apps, weather apps, etc etc, there are very good substitutes now in F-Droid. You're definitely making a trade-off though.  What I did was go through the apps I had installed on my last phone, found as many substitutes in F-Droid as I could, started using those instead to see how they worked, and bit by bit replaced as much as I could from Google Play with a comparable app from F-Droid. I still have a few apps (mostly vendor-specific things that don't have substitutes) that come from Google Play but I'm aiming to be rid of those before I need to replace this phone.

2023-09-01T13:58:23Z	(#7uig3sq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I use the gmail webapp for work, and I have to say that over the years it's gotten less and less usable. There are so many little usability things that it's bad at. For instance, if you select a message and hit the Delete key nothing happens. The message is not put in the trash like you'd expect. There are issues like that scattered all over the app. I suspect they spend most of their energy on the spyware side of gmail and dedicate less to making it a useful app for end users (which seems to be true of their search engine too).

These are rookie mistakes Google's making, *at scale*.  > Unfortunately Google employs dark patterns to convince you to sync your MFA codes to the cloud, and our employee had indeed activated this “feature”. If you install Google Authenticator from the app store directly, and follow the suggested instructions, your MFA codes are by default saved to the cloud. If you want to disable it, there isn’t a clear way to “disable syncing to the cloud”, instead there is just a “unlink Google account” option.  Like, never ever put your multi-factor tokens into a single cloud storage location! The whole point of this being "multi" factor is that there is a separate, independent physical factor involved in the authentication process. If the authenticator app on your phone puts the tokens in the cloud, then it reduces the security that comes from having a second factor. This is basic stuff.  Of course, never ever use Google Authenticator. All it does is generate TOTP and HOTP codes, which you can do with any OTP app, preferably an open source one that's been vetted.

The podcast below is an interview of an author of a study where they actually intervened and changed the information diet of 20,000 people (with consent!), then surveyed them after three months. They observed essentially no changes to the study subjects' beliefs and attitudes. They also observed that the typical person, while they tend to gravitate towards people with similar political leanings, only get about 50% of their content from such like-minded people. They get the rest from neutral sources and maybe 20% from non-like-minded people.  Varied information diet + No change in attitudes when information diet is forced to be different = no echo chamber.   [Listen to the podcast episode here](https://publicinfrastructure.org/podcast-download/1464/89-brendan-nyhan-pt-1.mp3)

I heard of it from @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt>, so blame him 😏 `snac` is written in C and is one simple executable, uses very little resources on the server, and stores everything in JSON files (no databases or other integrations; easy to save and migrate your data) . It's definitely like yarn in that respect.   I haven't been around yarn much lately. Part of that is that I've been very busy at work and home and only have a limited time to spend goofing off on a social network. Part of it is that I'm finding `snac` very useful: I've connected with friends I'd previously lost touch with, I've found useful work-related information, I've found colleagues to follow, and even found interesting conferences to attend. There's a lot more going on over there.   I guess if I had to put it simply, I'd say I have limited time to play and there are more kids in the ActivityPub sandbox than this one.

He was referring to the basic principles of LISP/the lambda calculus, which have sometimes been called the Maxwell's equations of computer programming (by Alan Kay). Simple, short, elegant, but very densely packed with meaning--generations of people have spent their whole careers unpacking what those simple rules can do.  Much of modern software feels like the polar opposite of that. Not only can you not write it on an index card, you never will be able to because people who write software don't seem to aspire to try. I wish more people thought this way though!

2024-07-25T01:58:00Z	Hack of the day: running `watch -n 60 rm -rf /tmp/yarn-avatar-*` in a `tmux` because all of a sudden, without warning, `yarnd` started throwing hundreds of gigabytes of files with names like `yarn-avatar-62582554` into `/tmp`, which filled up the entire disk and started crashing other services.

2024-07-25T15:21:39Z	(#ve43paq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Hitting that URL returns a bunch of HTML even though there is no user named `lovetocode999` on my pod.

2024-07-26T01:06:20Z	(#2rxkcca) @<stigatle https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/twtxt.txt> @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> "Not cool"? I was receiving many broken (HTTP 400 error) requests per second from an IP address I didn't recognize, right after having my VPS crash because the hard drive filled up with bogus data. None of this had happened on this VPS before, so it was a new problem that I didn't understand and I took immediate action to get it under control. Of course I reported the IP address to its abuse email. That's a 100% normal, natural, and "cool" thing to do in such a situation. At the time I had no idea it was @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> .  The moment I realized it was @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> and definitely a false alarm, I emailed the ISP and told them this was a false positive and to not ban or block the IP in question because it was not abusive traffic. They haven't yet responded but I do hope they've stopped taking action, and if there's anything else I can do to certify to them that this is not abuse then I will do that.  I run numerous services on that VPS that I rely on, and I spent most of my day today cleaning up the mess all this has caused. I get that this caused @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> a lot of stress and I'm sincerely sorry about that and am doing what I can to rectify the situation. But calling me "not cool" isn't necessary. This was an unfortunate situation that we're trying to make right and there's no need for criticizing anyone.
2024-07-26T13:18:10Z	(#2rxkcca) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I don't think it's your code. As you said in one of your commit comments, the internet is a hostile place! That's partly why I reacted the way I did: all things considered it's usually better to react quickly and clean up the mess later, then it is to wait and risk further damage. Anyway it sucks @<xuu https://txt.sour.is/user/xuu/twtxt.txt> got caught up in it. Hopefully it's all good now.

I don't technically want open registrations on my pod but up till now I've been too lazy to figure out how to turn them off and actually do that, and there hasn't been a pressing need. I may have to now.
2024-08-26T01:34:56Z	There is a bug in `yarnd` that's been around for awhile and is still present in the current version I'm running that lets a person hit a constructed URL like  ``` YOUR_POD/external?nick=lovetocode999&uri=https://socialmphl.com/story19510368/doujin ```  and see a legitimate-looking page on YOUR_POD, with an HTTP code 200 (success). From that fake page you can even follow an external feed. Try it yourself, replacing "YOUR_POD" with the URL of any `yarnd` pod you know. Try following the feed.  I think URLs like this should return errors. They should not render HTML, nor produce legitimate-looking pages. This mechanism is ripe for DDoS attacks. My pod gets roughly 70,000 hits per day to URLs like this. Many are porn or other types of content I do not want. At this point, if it's not fixed soon I am going to have to shut down my pod. @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> please have a look.
2024-08-26T01:48:30Z	(#krlhs5a) For some reason this nick `lovetocode999` is frequently present in my log entries.
2024-08-26T17:44:16Z	(#krlhs5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Ah nice, thank you! Do you think this fix is ready for me to test it or do you think I should wait til you poke at it?
2024-08-26T17:45:59Z	(#bwsmumq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Ha, sweet thanks for this! For some reason I thought you had to do this with an environmental variable or command-line option and I didn't think to check the settings. 🤦‍♂
2024-08-26T19:20:49Z	(#bwsmumq) @<lyse https://lyse.isobeef.org/twtxt.txt> Interesting. The `yarnd --help` currently says (for me):  ```   -R, --open-registrations            whether or not to have open user registgration  ```  meaning it doesn't give the default setting or warn you that you need to use `-R=false` and not `-R false`. It also leaves unclear whether `--open-registrations false` would work or if you need to do `--open-registrations=false`. It's also unclear whether the setting change in the user interface is overridden by the command line arguments, overrides the command line arguments, is persisted across restarts.  Maybe all this is worth posting an issue for additional documentation on the git repo if there isn't one already.  "registgration" is misspelled that way in the help by the way.
2024-08-27T14:22:20Z	(#krlhs5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> I partially agree with bender on this one I think. The way this person is abusing the `/external` endpoint on my pod seems to be to generate legitimate-looking HTML content for external sites, using a username that does not exist on my pod. One "semantically correct" thing to do would be to error out if that username does not exist on the pod. It's not unlike having a mail server configured as an open relay at this point.  It would also be very helpful to give the pod administrator control over what's being fetched this way. I don't want people using my pod to redirect porn sites or whatever. If I could have something as simple as the ability to blacklist URLs that'd already help.
2024-08-27T15:32:10Z	(#krlhs5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I believe you are not seeing the problem I am describing.  Hit this URL in your web browser:  https://twtxt.net/external?nick=lovetocode999&uri=https://socialmphl.com/story19510368/doujin  That's your pod. I assume you don't have a user named `lovetocode999` on your pod. Yet that URL returns HTTP status 200, and generates HTML, complete with a link to `https://socialmphl.com/story19510368/doujin`, which is not a twtxt feed (that's where the ` twtxt.txt` link goes if you click it). That link could be to anything, including porn, criminal stuff, etc, and it will appear to be coming from your twtxt.net domain.  What I am saying is that this is a bug. If there is no user `lovetocode999` on the pod, hitting this URL should not return HTTP 200 status, and it should definitely not be generating valid HTML with links in it.  Edit: Oops, I misunderstood the purpose of this `/external` endpoint. Still, since the `uri` is not a `yarn` pod, let alone one with a user named `lovetocode999` on it, I stand by the belief that URLs like this should be be generating valid HTML with links to unknown sites. Shouldn't it be possible to construct a valid target URL from the `nick` and `uri` instead of using the pod's `/external` endpoint?
2024-08-27T15:44:08Z	(#krlhs5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Aha, now it gives an error. OK I'm updating to this to see if it fixes the issue on my pod! Thank you.
2024-08-27T15:57:16Z	(#krlhs5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> This does not seem to fix the problem for me, or I've done something wrong. I did the following:  1. Pull the latest version from `git` (I have commit `7ad848`, same as on `twtxt.net` I believe). 2. `make build` and `make install` 3. Restart `yarnd` 4. Refresh cache in Poderator Settings  Yet I still see these bogus `/external` things on my pod when I hit URLs like the one I sent you recently. When I hit such a URL with `curl` I think it's giving an error? But in a web browser, the (buggy) response is the same as it was before I updated.  So, this problem is not fixed for me.
2024-08-27T16:01:37Z	(#krlhs5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> Here's a log entry: ``` Aug 27 15:59:43 buc yarnd[1200580]: [yarnd] 2024/08/27 15:59:43 (IP_REDACTED) "GET /external?nick=lovetocode999&uri=https://URL_REDACTED HTTP/1.1" 200 35442 14.554763ms ```  HTTP 200 status, not 404.
2024-08-27T16:06:19Z	(#krlhs5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> What? I compiled, updated, and restarted. If you check what my pod reports, it gives that 7a... SHA. I don't know what that other screenshot is showing but it seems to be out of date. That was the SHA I was running before this update.
2024-08-27T16:09:51Z	(#krlhs5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> "Refresh cache in Poderator Settings"  Is there some other way to do that?
2024-08-27T16:25:15Z	(#krlhs5a) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I deleted a file named `cache` in my yarn data and restarted. Problem persists.
2024-08-27T16:34:39Z	(#krlhs5a) A stopgap setting that would let me stop all calls to `/external` matching a particular pattern (like this damn `lovetocode999` nick) would do the job. Given the potential for abuse of that endpoint, having more moderation control over what it can do is probably a good idea.
2024-08-27T17:51:28Z	(#4hqmipq) @<bender https://twtxt.net/user/bender/twtxt.txt> Oh look at that, the same problem is still happening on `twtxt.net` too. I tested a different link but that one gave an error. Maybe that means my pod isn't behaving different from `twtxt.net` after all.

2024-08-28T15:40:23Z	(#vowtikq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> OK, I just updated to commit `77d527`, which looks to be the same one you're running right now. I forgot to blow away my cache before restarting, so I just deleted the `cache` file and restarted.
2024-08-28T16:02:04Z	(#vowtikq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> I'm not sure what this update does, but   ``` https://twtxt.net/external?uri=https://google.com&nick=lovetocode999 ```  still exhibits the same problem, on your pod and on mine, after the latest update.
2024-08-28T23:56:25Z	(#vowtikq) @<prologic https://twtxt.net/user/prologic/twtxt.txt> My pod, which is running the same commit you are, does not return an error like that. It returns the same HTML it always has. Try it. I nuked my cache before restarting.  Edit: Oh wait, the plot thickens. I do get an error if I use curl or if I use a web browser that isn't logged in. That's good!
2024-08-30T15:19:08Z	(#fwgehva) @<New_scientist https://feeds.twtxt.net/New_scientist/twtxt.txt> It's great that US regulators have approved launching 40,000 satellites with a 5-year lifespan before we had this kind of information about what's likely to happen when they start falling out of orbit at a rate of several per hour.
