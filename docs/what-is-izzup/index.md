## Why NOT ActivityPub?

## Why NOT BluSky.social?

## How it works

### Invite Only

* People pay a fee to become a `member` of the co-op.
* Pioneer members and above may `sponsor` `guest members`.
* Guest members cannot invite new members, and have no voting rights.
* If a guest member becomes a full member, their sponsor can then sponsor a new guest.
* A full member may `recind` a sponsorship invitation.
* A guest membership may be `revoked` by the full member at any time, opening the spot for another guest.
* If a guest membership is `canceled` by the platform, the full member may not be able to invite a new guest.
* Guest memberships are otherwise valid as long as the sponsoring full member is in good standing.
* 

### Codewise
